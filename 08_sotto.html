						As a successful artist, athlete, and prominent congressman, Vicente "Tito" Sotto III had one of the most unusual careers in Philippine public service. He was already well-known as a national bowling champion and the musical leader of the renowned band VST & Co. long before he entered politics. Additionally, he wrote the well-known 1986 EDSA Revolution anthem, "Magkaisa." He started his career in government in 1988 as the vice mayor of Quezon City, where he launched his well-known and protracted campaign against illegal drugs. He wrote more than 100 laws during his many years in the Senate, culminating a truly remarkable and diverse career that earned him the chamber's top position as Senate President.
