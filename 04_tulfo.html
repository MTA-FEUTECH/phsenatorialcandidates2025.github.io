						Erwin Tulfo, a 2025 senate candidate who was once a well-known and scathing broadcast journalist, takes his unwavering fight against corruption and support for the average Filipino to the national political arena. His policy is based on increasing pro-poor social welfare programs, guaranteeing unwavering accountability, and improving government transparency through digitization. His candidacy is scrutinized, nevertheless, with legal issues arising from his affiliation with a well-known political dynasty and unanswered citizenship difficulties. Tulfo continues to be a divisive figure, portraying himself as an advocate for the marginalized whose bold reform pledge is balanced against ingrained reservations about dynastic politics.
